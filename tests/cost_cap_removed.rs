//! The spend cap is gone: a spend state that used to refuse must now grant.
//!
//! This is a reproduction of the reported symptom, not a test of the diff. The
//! user's installed app emitted, on every attempt:
//!
//! ```text
//! [tinyagents::mw] cost budget exceeded — failing before model call
//!     current_usd=10.0341857 limit_usd=10 period=Day
//! ```
//!
//! and surfaced it as "Something went wrong. Please try again." — advice that
//! could not work, because the refusal happened *before* the model call, so
//! every retry hit the same wall.
//!
//! It lives in its own integration binary rather than beside the module for one
//! reason: `GLOBAL_TRACKER` is a process-wide `OnceCell`
//! (`platform/cost/global.rs`). A unit test that installs a global tracker wins
//! or loses depending on which test in the shared `--lib` process got there
//! first, so the reproduction would be order-dependent — and an order-dependent
//! reproduction that happens to find `None` proves nothing, because the gate
//! treats "no tracker" as "no budget opinion" and grants. One test per process
//! is what makes the spend state below actually reach the code under test.
