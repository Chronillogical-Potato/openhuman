//! Which operating mode this process serves.
//!
//! | [`Mode`] | Who the process serves |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`Mode::SingleUser`] | One user on their own machine — the desktop app, the CLI, embedders. Today's behaviour and the default. |
//! | [`Mode::Saas`] | Many users through a trusted gateway, one embedded agent per user, with closed defaults. |
//!
//! The mode is a property of the **process**, fixed the first time a SaaS core
//! boots ([`lock_mode`]) and never part of any user's `Config`: a mode a
//! config write or an RPC could flip would let a caller reopen everything SaaS
//! closes. Code that must behave differently asks [`is_saas`], which reads an
//! unset slot as `SingleUser`, so a process that never boots SaaS takes no new
//! branch.
