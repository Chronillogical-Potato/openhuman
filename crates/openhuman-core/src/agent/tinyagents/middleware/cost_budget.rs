/// Token-accounting parity observer. It once enforced OpenHuman's
/// daily/monthly cost budgets before a model call spent (issue #4249, Phase 5),
/// failing the run before the provider call when a budget was already
/// exceeded. That cap is gone and nothing here refuses any more; a warning
/// threshold logs but proceeds. This enforcement path stays **authoritative**.
///
/// Self-gating: a no-op unless a global tracker exists and `config.enabled` with
/// a limit is set (`check_budget` returns `Allowed` otherwise). Complements the
/// post-call `StopHookMiddleware` per-turn USD cap. Projecting the *next* call's
/// cost pre-spend (vs the already-exceeded check here) needs an input-token
/// estimate — a follow-up.

/// # Shadow role (W2-budget-dedupe)
///
/// When built with [`with_shadow`](Self::with_shadow), this middleware is ALSO a
/// divergence-logging shadow over the observe-only crate
/// [`BudgetMiddleware`](tinyagents_harness::middleware::BudgetMiddleware). It
/// keeps enforcing exactly as before, but at `after_agent` it compares the
/// crate `BudgetMiddleware`'s shared [`BudgetTracker`] accumulation against the
/// authoritative runtime [`AgentRun::usage`] and logs `[budget_shadow]` parity
/// or divergence (compact numeric summary; no PII). Both accumulate the same
/// per-call `response.usage`, so token totals must match once the crate
/// middleware is on the path — this is the parity signal that must be clean
/// before enforcement can flip to the crate owner (see the flip-criteria comment
/// at the registration site in `tinyagents/mod.rs`). Cost is intentionally NOT
/// compared: the observe-only crate middleware has no pricing table, so its cost
/// stays zero while the local path prices via `cost::catalog` — cost parity is a
/// flip-criteria follow-up.
